# spam-1-vbcc
Port of the VBCC C compiler to SPAM-1

This is a work in progress.

Compiler handles 32 bt integers and the list of test programs in the demo folder highlight the supported features.
Other features may work but without a test program I don't know.

For info on the SPAM-1 target hardware see https://github.com/Johnlon/spam-1
